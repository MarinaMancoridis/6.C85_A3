				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Insight 1.</b> The number of new COVID-19 cases <i>increases</i> in the winter months, as demonstrated by the increased thickness of the red 
					lines on the top of the spiral graph.
				</li>
				<li><b>Insight 2.</b> The number of new COVID-19 cases has generally increased from 2020 (when there were around no cases). Since the beginning of 
					the pandemic, the number of new cases reached its lowest point in July of 2021 and its highest point in January of 2022.
				</li>
				<li><b>Insight 3.</b> The number of new COVID-19 cases spiked in July of 2021, as indicated by the fanning out of the red spiral in the topmost 
					portion of the graph. The trend suggest that the number of new cases might increase further after that point.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Insight 4.</b> The number of new COVID-19 cases <i>decreases</i> in the summer months, as demonstrated by the decreased thickness of the red lines 
					on the top of the spiral graph.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Insight 5.</b> The year 2020 had much fewer COVID-19 cases than either 2021 or 2022. The number of cases in the winter months of 2021 was generally 
					more than the number of cases in the winter months of 2022. 
				</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Critique 1 (prominance of information).</b> The visualization is effective at showing the general trends of how new COVID-19 cases have
					risen and fallen from January of 2020 to January of 2022. It is clear that the cases have generally increased over the years, with the most cases 
					occuring during the winter months. However, the visualization makes it difficult to do any meaningful quantitative analysis of the data. For example,
					 the visualization does not allow the reader to easily compare the number of cases between different 
					time periods. Unless the reader wants to compare the number of cases between the same month in different years, the visualization does not allow for 
					direct visual comparisons between different months. To compare cases between, say, March and November, the viewer must mentally juggle 
					the lengths of red bands as they curve around—a cognitive load that the design seems willing to trade for an elegant overall narrative. Moreover, 
					the visualization displays redundant 
					information by showing the number of cases both above and below the black line. Finally, the legend only shows the size of 150K new cases, but certain 
					regions of the graph have more than 150K new cases. This makes it difficult for the reader to understand the scale of the graph. The designers of the 
					visualization constrained the ability of the reader to both quantify and compare the number of new cases between different months. However, this tradeoff 
					was made to enable the reader to easily see the general trends of the number of new cases over time and to provide a general assessment of seasonal 
					differences in cases. 
				</li>
				<li><b>Critique 2 (intended audience).</b> The publication medium of the visualization
					However, the visualization could be improved by providing more context about the data. For example, the
					visualization could include information about the social distancing restrictions and policies that were in place during the time period shown in the
					graph. This would help viewers understand why the number of cases increased or decreased during certain months.
