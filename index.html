				<b>Insights about the data/visualization:</b>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Insight 1.</b> The number of new COVID-19 cases <i>increases</i> in the winter months, as demonstrated by the increased thickness of the red 
					lines on the top of the spiral graph.
				</li>
				<li><b>Insight 2.</b> The number of new COVID-19 cases has generally increased from 2020 (when there were around no cases). Since the beginning of 
					the pandemic, the number of new cases reached its lowest point in July of 2021 and its highest point in January of 2022.
				</li>
				<li><b>Insight 3.</b> The number of new COVID-19 cases spiked in July of 2021, as indicated by the fanning out of the red spiral in the topmost 
					portion of the graph. The trend suggest that the number of new cases might increase further after that point.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Insight 4.</b> The number of new COVID-19 cases <i>decreases</i> in the summer months, as demonstrated by the decreased thickness of the red lines 
					on the top of the spiral graph.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Insight 5.</b> The year 2020 had much fewer COVID-19 cases than either 2021 or 2022. The number of cases in the winter months of 2021 was generally 
					more than the number of cases in the winter months of 2022. 
				</li>
			</ul>

				<b>Design Critique:</b>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Critique 1 (prominance of information).</b> This visualization tells a story—a sweeping narrative of a pandemic in motion. 
					It captures the broad, unmistakable trends: COVID-19 cases climbing from January 2020 to January 2022 and surging notably 
					during the winter months. In doing so, it provides a clear, macro-level picture of seasonal peaks and gradual increases. 
					Yet, this focus on the overarching pattern comes at a price. The design sacrifices the ability to easily compare exact 
					numbers between different time periods. Rather than offering a straightforward way to quantify month-to-month differences, 
					it forces the viewer to mentally juggle the lengths of curved red bands and decode redundant labels. Even the legend, capped 
					at 150K, falls short when some spikes go beyond that threshold, muddying our sense of scale. Moreover, 
					the visualization displays redundant information by showing the number of cases both above and below the black line. The 
					tradeoff that the designers made between narrative and ease of 
					quantatative analysis is clear: the visualization was made to enable the reader to easily see the general trends of the number of new cases 
					over time and to provide a general assessment of seasonal 
					differences in cases. 
				</li>
				<li><b>Critique 2 (intended audience).</b> The visualization in the New York Times is designed for a broad audience, at a moment when public 
					anxiety about COVID-19 was at its peak. Its role at the start of the article is simple: provide a clear, digestible snapshot of the 
					pandemic's trends—rising cases, especially in winter. But this clarity comes at a cost. Context is sacrificed in exchange for narrative flow.
					While the text of the article discusses that the number of cases is often delayed during the two weeks beginning shortly before Christmas until shortly after New Year’s Day
					and that SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are likely to play a role in the progression of the disease, the visualization itself lacks any context. 
					Contextual annotations could have been very helpful for anxiety-ridden readers; if the designers had included information about key policy shifts, social 
					distancing practices, or reporting delays, readers could have better understood the reasons behind the trends. The lack of contextual annotations, of course, is the results of an intentional choice made by the designers in the tradeoff between
					providing a clear narrative and providing context for the data. Their ultimate choice invites readers to dive into the article for more details, but 
					fundamentally limits their capacity to draw data-driven insights at the beginning of the article.
				</li>
				<li><b>Critique 3 (visual encodings).</b> The visualization uses a spiral graph to represent the number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States. This 
					graph is a unique and creative way to represent the reader; as a result, it immediately draws intrigue. However, it is unclear that the reader is 
					supposed to read the graph from the center outwards. This sacrifices the overarching temporal narrative of the data. Moreover, the scale of the graph
					is difficult to interpret: later years extend over a larger area than earlier ones, leaving it 
					unclear if the red segments are proportionally adjusted. These design choices sacrifice the narrative structure of the data and introduces ambiguity 
					in how to interpret scale measurements. However, the spiral introduces a refreshing visual twist in an era of information overload and heightened 
					anxiety, trading off the clarity of a coherent narrative for aesthetic intrigue.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
				This is a context-annotated visualization that shows the number of new COVID-19 cases 
				in the United States from January 2020 to January 2022. The number of new cases is depicted 
				in a split y-axis, while the x-axis shows time in months. The visualization includes annotations
				that provide context for the data, such as key case reporting information, vaccine releases, and 
				policy changes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				<b>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</b>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 1. </b> My <b>motivation</b> behind generating this sketch was to provide a visualization that
					includes context for the data. This was accomplished with gray annotations that denoted 
					key case reporting information, vaccine releases, and
					policy changes. This is in response to the critique that the original visualization lacked context for the 
					presented data.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 2.</b> I was hoping that this visualization would <b>communicate</b> the narrative elements of the 
					data by situating the information in broader, clarifying context. This is important because the original visualization was 
					published during a time of high public anxiety.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 3.</b> Some things <b>worked well</b> in this visualization. For example, the split y-axis
					 highlights a trend that was relatively hidden in the first visualization: the 
					last month in the dataset had the highest numer of new cases of COVID-19. This decision was made in response 
					to my critique that the original visualization did not provide a way for 
					readers to make quantitative analyses. Another thing that worked well was using colors to represent different 
					years (with red representing 2022, the year with the highest number of new cases in any month). Finally, there is a
					high data-to-ink ratio. White space was limited without the visualization feeling cramped.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 4.</b> Some things <b>did not work well</b> in this visualization. For example, it is misleading 
					that only January and July are the labeled months. While this decision was intended to reduce clutter, it 
					unnecessarily highlights these months. Moreover, the annotations imply causal reasons for the trends in 
					the data, which may have been influenced by a variety of factors. This could be misleading to the readers.
					Finally, the split y-axis may be confusing to readers who are not familiar with this type of visualization.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 5.</b> <b>Future work</b> on this visualization could include more annotations to make it 
					obvious that the annotations are not causal. Rather, they are included to situate the data in a 
					broader historical narrative of the time period. Moreover, the color palette could be adjusted to
					be more accessible to colorblind readers. Finally, the number of existing cases could be included in a 
					side-by-side graphic to provide context with implications for hospital capacity, public health policy, and 
					societal morale.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>In the next visualization, </b> I would like to further explore ways to make the historical narrative of the 
					dataset more obvious.
				</li>
			</ul>

				<figcaption>
					This visualization serves as a data-augmented form of photo journaling. The grey squiggles are placeholders 
					for text that includes historical context. The number of new cases is included in the color of each photograph's border (binned 
					into seven categories of severity). The photographs are arranged in a directed path to represent the passage
					of time, with each row representing a different year.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				<b>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</b>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 1. </b> My <b>motivation</b> behind generating this sketch was to provide a visualization that 
					feels more human and personal. This was accomplished by using photographs to augment the data. The data journalism
					form factor of this illustration is intended to make the data more relatable, visceral, and emotional to the reader.
					The captions are intended to provide context for the data. This structure evokes a historical narrative of the 
					COVID-19 pandemic, bringing the data "to life".
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 2.</b> I was hoping that this visualization would <b>communicate</b> the historical narrative that 
					accompanies the dataset. The colors of the borders of the photographs are intended to provide a quick, at-a-glance
					understanding of the severity of the number of new cases. The photographs are arranged in a directed path to
					represent the passage of time and the context is intended to provide a historical narrative of the time period.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 3.</b> Some things <b>worked well</b> in this visualization. For example, the data does not clutter 
					the intended narrative, but rather augments it. The photographs are intended to evoke an emotional response from the
					reader, which makes the data more relatable. The arrangement of the photographis in a directed path 
					helps the reader understand the passage of time (unlike the original illustration, which provided no clear indication of
					the "starting point" of the visualization). Finally, the visualization does not appear cluttered and has a high data-ink ratio.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 4.</b> Some things <b>did not work well</b> in this visualization. For example, the order that you should 
					read information in the directed path is not intuitive. The reader has to read from left to right, then right to left, 
					then left to right again. This could be confusing to the reader. Moreover, a different month is highlighted in each 
					year (ie. November in 2021, but not in 2020). While these design choices were meant to highlight the most consequential 
					months, the distribution of the selected data that is displayed is not made clear to the reader. Finally, the 
					visualization feels perceptually incomplete because the last year (2022) only has data for the first month. This is a 
					direct consequence of the information available in the dataset, but may feel like an arbitrary decision to a lay 
					reader.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 5.</b> <b>Future work</b> on this visualization could include more photographs to provide a more even 
					spread across the months of each year. The color palette could have been chosen to be more accessible to colorblind
					readers. Finally, the photographs could be arranged in a more intuitive order to make the visualization easier to read
					(ie. always left to right or up to down).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>In the next visualization, </b> I would like to display the information about new cases alongside other 
					meaningful statistics (new deaths, new recovered patients, etc.) to provide a more comprehensive view of the
					impact of COVID-19.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="vis3.jpeg" alt="" style="width:70%; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
				This visualization highlights the progression of four key statistics related to COVID-19 from 2020 to 2022: 
				the <b>average</b> number of new confirmed cases, deaths, recovered patients, and tested individuals per month. Each statistic is 
				represented by a different color and column. The y-axis indicates time (in months). The visualization is meant 
				to be read from the top to the bottom. The key provides a way to interpret the size of each bubble as the number 
				of people associated with each statistic. The grey squiggles are placeholders for text that includes historical context.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				<b>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</b>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 1. </b> My <b>motivation</b> behind generating this sketch was to accompany the initial data (number 
					of new cases) with further statistics to provide a more comprehensive view of the impact of COVID-19.
					I accomplish this by including a separate column for each of four statistics: new confirmed cases, new deaths,
					new recovered patients, and new tested individuals. This is in response to the critique that the original
					visualization was limited by its univariate summarization.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 2.</b> I was hoping that this visualization would <b>communicate</b> a broader narrative of the 
					COVID-19 pandemic by including more statistics. The colors of the columns are intended to provide a quick, at-a-glance
					understanding of each statistic. The bubbles allow readers to quickly understand the different dynamics at any 
					given month (ie. high deaths in early 2021 accompanied by relatively few new confirmed cases).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 3.</b> Some things <b>worked well</b> in this visualization. For example, for any given month, the 
					reader can quickly understand the relative impact of each statistic. The bubbles are sized according to the number
					of people associated with each statistic, which provides a quick, at-a-glance understanding of the data. Moreover, the 
					bubbles are binned into five sizes to avoid issues with understanding continuous data. Finally, the visualization
					does not feel cluttered and has a high data-ink ratio.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 4.</b> Some things <b>did not work well</b> in this visualization. For example, the key slighly obscures 
					the fact that a different size interval is associated with each statistic. This could be confusing to the reader who 
					only looks at a visualization in a quick glance. Moreover, aggregating the statistics by month hides intra-month trends that are available 
					in the original data. Finally, it is not obvious that the visualization is meant to be read from top to bottom.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Rationale 5.</b> <b>Future work</b> on this visualization could provide text that makes it obvious that a different size 
					intervals are associated with each statitic. The visulzation could also be flipped so that it is read from left to right, 
					which might be more intuitive for the reader. Finally,
